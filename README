*increment-activator* is a powerful increment plugin.

The behavior is like <C-a>, <C-x> increment or decrement number by the default Vim

It has been enhanced to allow increment the list that you have defined.

The list will be generated in candidates patterns automatically.

Pattern of candidates:
- no changes (that you have defined)
- lower
- UPPER
- Capitalize
